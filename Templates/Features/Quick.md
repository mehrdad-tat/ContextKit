# Quick Task Template

<!-- Template Version: 3 | ContextKit: 0.2.9 | Updated: 2025-01-17 -->

## Description

Quick task planning template for smaller tasks, bug fixes, and focused improvements that need planning but don't require the full multi-file workflow (Spec/Tech/Steps). Includes interactive validation, codebase analysis, and may include online research.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🤖 SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS - QUICK TASK TEMPLATE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ PURPOSE: This template guides AI assistants in creating quick task plans for
║ smaller tasks, bug fixes, and improvements that don't require the full
║ feature planning workflow. These tasks are substantial enough to need planning
║ but don't require separate Spec/Tech/Steps files.
║
║ EXECUTION FLOW:
║
║ Phase 1: Template Population (called by /ctxk:plan:quick)
║ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
║ This template is populated by the /ctxk:plan:quick command after interactive
║ validation with the user. The command handles:
║ - Gathering user input
║ - Analyzing codebase (may include online research)
║ - Interactive understanding validation
║ - Generating this file with confirmed understanding
║
║ 2. Populate Input section
║ - Use Edit to replace "[User's original description - verbatim]"
║ - Keep the original description exactly as provided
║ - Use triple quotes to preserve formatting
║
║ 3. Populate Understanding section
║ - Use Edit to replace summary with confirmed understanding
║ - Be as detailed as necessary - these tasks are smaller but substantial
║ - Fill In Scope items (as many as needed for clarity)
║ - Fill Out of Scope items (clearly define boundaries)
║ - Fill Edge Cases (all relevant edge cases to consider)
║ - This section was already validated with user in chat
║
║ 4. Populate Code Context section
║ - Use Edit to add relevant file paths with line numbers
║ - Document current patterns found in codebase
║ - Note integration points and dependencies
║ - Include as much context as needed for understanding
║ - **If online research was conducted**: Populate Research Sources subsection with:
║ - Technology/framework names with URLs and versions
║ - Documentation or article URLs with access dates
║ - **If NO online research was needed**: Remove Research Sources subsection entirely
║
║ 5. Populate Implementation Approach section
║ - Use Edit to add detailed technical approach
║ - Document key decisions and rationale
║ - Reference architectural patterns from Context.md
║ - Include any research findings or online resources consulted
║ - Be thorough - if the task needed ContextKit, it needs proper planning
║
║ 6. Populate Tasks section
║ - Use Edit to generate specific tasks (as many as needed)
║ - Each task should be actionable with clear acceptance criteria
║ - Include file paths where applicable
║ - Optionally add build validation task (using Task tool with build-project agent)
║
║ 7. Clean up template
║ - Use Edit to remove this entire boxed section
║ - Leave only the content sections
║
║ Phase 2: Manual Execution (User-driven)
║ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
║ Users work through the task list manually:
║ - Check off tasks as completed
║ - Add notes to the Notes section as needed
║ - Optionally use Task tool with build-project agent to verify compilation
║ - Commit changes manually with git
║
║ VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
║ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
║ Before removing this section, verify:
║ - [ ] Input section filled with verbatim user description
║ - [ ] Understanding section filled with confirmed scope (as detailed as needed)
║ - [ ] In Scope clearly defines what will be addressed
║ - [ ] Out of Scope clearly defines boundaries
║ - [ ] Edge Cases identifies relevant considerations
║ - [ ] Code Context includes relevant files and patterns
║ - [ ] Implementation Approach is thorough and clear
║ - [ ] Tasks section has actionable items with clear criteria
║ - [ ] All placeholder text replaced
║ - [ ] This boxed section removed
║
