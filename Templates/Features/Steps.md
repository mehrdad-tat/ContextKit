# Implementation Steps: [Feature from Tech.md]
<!-- Template Version: 12 | ContextKit: 0.2.2 | Updated: 2025-10-17 -->

## Description
Implementation task breakdown template providing systematic S001-S999 task enumeration with parallel execution markers and dependency analysis for iOS/macOS development workflows.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: This File is Your Progress Tracker

**This Steps.md file serves as the authoritative source of truth for implementation progress across all development sessions.**

### Key Principles
- **Token limits are irrelevant** - Progress is tracked here, sessions are resumable
- **Never rush or take shortcuts** - Each step deserves proper attention and time
- **Session boundaries don't matter** - User can resume where this file shows progress
- **Steps.md is the real todo list** - Even if AI uses TodoWrite during a session, THIS file is what persists
- **Quality over speed** - Thoroughness is mandatory, optimization for token limits is forbidden
- **Check off progress here** - Mark tasks as complete in this file as they're finished

### How This Works
1. Each task has a checkbox: `- [ ] **S001** Task description`
2. As tasks complete, they're marked: `- [x] **S001** Task description`
3. AI ignores token limit concerns and works methodically through steps
4. If context usage gets high (>80%), AI suggests user runs `/compact` before continuing
5. If session ends: User starts new session and resumes (this file has all progress)
6. Take the time needed for each step - there's no rush to finish in one session

║ 🤖 EXECUTION FLOW - IMPLEMENTATION STEPS GENERATION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ ## Execution Flow (main)
║
║ ### Phase 1: Prerequisites & Planning Analysis
║
║ 1. **Load Technical Planning**
║    - Use `Read` tool to read current feature directory Tech.md: `Read Context/Features/[FeatureName]/Tech.md`
║    - If missing: ERROR "Technical planning required - run /ctxk:plan:2-research-tech first"
║    - If 🚨 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist: ERROR "Resolve technical uncertainties first"
║    - Extract from Research & Analysis section: technology decisions, API constraints, integration patterns, version requirements
║    - Extract from Technical Architecture section: architecture decisions, component structure, dependencies
║    - Cross-reference research findings with architecture for implementation constraints
║    - Document technology limitations and best practices for implementation guidance
║
║ 2. **Load Feature Specification**
║    - Use `Read` tool to read current feature directory Spec.md: `Read Context/Features/[FeatureName]/Spec.md`
║    - Extract: user stories, functional requirements, acceptance criteria
║    - Map requirements to implementation tasks with research-informed constraints
║
║ 3. **Analyze Implementation Complexity and Scope**
║    - Count: new files, modified files, new APIs, tests needed
║    - If scope > 25 tasks: WARN "Consider breaking into smaller features"
║    - **Knowledge Gap Assessment**: Evaluate API documentation quality and newness
║      - Well-documented Apple APIs = Low Risk
║      - Community-documented technologies = Medium Risk
║      - New/niche/poorly documented APIs = High Risk
║    - Identify critical path and parallel opportunities
║
║ ### Phase 2: Task Generation & Organization
║
║ 4. **Apply Task Generation Rules with Research-Informed Constraints**
║    - Apply technology limitations from research (version requirements, rate limits, API constraints)
║    - Include integration patterns discovered in codebase analysis
║    - Consider performance implications documented in architectural pattern research
║    - **AI-Assisted Development Considerations**: Factor in knowledge gaps and documentation quality for realistic time estimates
║    - One task per file creation/modification
║    - One task per API endpoint implementation
║    - One task per data model definition
║    - One task per significant UI component
║    - TDD approach: tests before implementation
║    - **Xcode Project Management**: Manual user actions required for complex Xcode project changes
║      - Target creation/deletion = Manual user action with standardized box format
║      - Scheme modifications = Manual user action when complex
║      - Simple Info.plist updates = Automated task (allowed)
║      - Build setting changes = Automated task when straightforward
║
║ 5. **Generate Tasks with S### Enumeration (S001, S002...)**
║    - Setup tasks: Project structure, dependencies, configuration (S001-S010)
║    - Model tasks: Data layer implementation with TDD approach (S011-S020)
║    - Service tasks: Business logic and API integration (S021-S030)
║    - UI tasks: SwiftUI views, navigation, user interaction (S031-S040)
║    - Integration tasks: **Automated testing only** - builds, unit tests, agents (S041-S050)
║    - Manual validation tasks: **User testing required** - running apps, interactions (S051-S060)
║    - Polish tasks: Performance, compliance, release prep (S061-S070)
║
║ 6. **Apply Parallel Execution Markers [P]**
║    - Different files = [P] parallel safe
║    - Same file = sequential only
║    - Independent components = [P] parallel safe
║    - Shared resources = sequential only
║    - Tests can run [P] with their implementation counterparts
║
║ ### Phase 3: Dependency Analysis & Validation
║
║ 7. **Validate Dependency Chains with Research Constraints**
║    - Apply external service dependencies and rate limiting from research

## AI-Assisted Development Time Estimation *(Claude Code + Human Review)*

> **⚠️ ESTIMATION BASIS**: These estimates assume development with Claude Code (AI) executing implementation tasks with human review and guidance. Times reflect AI execution + human review cycles, not manual coding.

### Phase-by-Phase Review Time
**Setup & Configuration**: [AI Generated human review time]
- *AI executes quickly, human reviews project structure and dependencies*

**Data Layer**: [AI Generated human review time]
- *AI implements models/tests, human validates business logic and data relationships*

**Service Layer**: [AI Generated human review time]
- *AI builds services, human reviews integration patterns and error handling*

**User Interface**: [AI Generated human review time]
- *AI creates UI components, human tests user experience and visual design*

**Integration & Quality**: [AI Generated human review time]
- *AI runs quality checks, human performs acceptance testing and validates workflows*

### Knowledge Gap Risk Factors
**🟢 Low Risk** (Well-documented Apple APIs): Minimal correction cycles expected
**🟡 Medium Risk** (Community-documented technologies): Some refinement iterations likely
**🔴 High Risk** (New/niche APIs with limited documentation): Multiple correction cycles expected

**API Documentation Quality Impact**:
- **Excellent docs** (Apple frameworks): ~10% additional review time
- **Good community docs**: ~25% additional review time
- **Poor/sparse docs**: ~50-100% additional review time
- **Brand new/beta APIs**: ~100%+ additional review time

### Total Estimated Review Time
**Core Development**: [AI Generated base time for human review]
**Risk-Adjusted Time**: [AI Generated time with knowledge gap factors]
**Manual Testing Allocation**: [AI Generated testing time estimate]

> **💡 TIME COMPOSITION**:
> - AI Implementation: ~10-20% (Claude Code executes quickly)
> - Human Review: ~40-50% (reading, understanding, testing)
> - Correction Cycles: ~20-30% (refinements and fixes)
> - Manual Testing: ~20-30% (validation and acceptance)

## Implementation Structure *(AI guidance)*

### Task Numbering Convention
- **Format**: `S###` with sequential numbering (S001, S002, S003...)
- **Parallel Markers**: `[P]` for tasks that can run concurrently
- **Dependencies**: Clear prerequisite task references
- **File Paths**: Specific target files for each implementation task

### Progress Tracking & Session Continuity
- **This file is the progress tracker** - Check off tasks as `[x]` when complete
- **Sessions are resumable** - New sessions read this file to see what's done
- **Token limits don't matter** - Work can span multiple sessions seamlessly
- **Never rush to completion** - Take the time each step needs for quality
- **TodoWrite is temporary** - Only this file persists across sessions
- **Quality is paramount** - Shortcuts and speed optimizations are forbidden

### Parallel Execution Rules
- **Different files** = `[P]` parallel safe
- **Same file modifications** = Sequential only
- **Independent components** = `[P]` parallel safe
- **Shared resources** = Sequential only
- **Tests with implementation** = Can run `[P]` parallel

### Manual User Action Format
For complex Xcode operations (target creation, scheme setup), use standardized format:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🎯 MANUAL XCODE ACTION REQUIRED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ [Step-by-step Xcode UI instructions]
║ [Specific menu paths and actions]
║
║ Reply "Done" when completed to continue.
```

### Quality Integration
*Built into implementation phases, not separate agent tasks*

- **Code Standards**: Follow Context/Guidelines patterns throughout
- **Error Handling**: Apply ErrorKit patterns during service implementation
- **UI Guidelines**: Follow SwiftUI patterns during UI implementation
- **Testing Coverage**: Include test tasks for each implementation phase
- **Platform Compliance**: Consider iOS/macOS requirements in each phase

## Dependency Analysis *(AI generated)*

### Critical Path
[AI Generated: Longest dependency chain through phases with AI-assisted time estimates]
