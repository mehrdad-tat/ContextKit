║ 🤖 EXECUTION FLOW - RESEARCH & TECHNICAL PLANNING
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ ## Execution Flow (main)
║
║ ### Phase 1: Research & Knowledge Acquisition
║
║ 1. **Load Feature Specification**
║    - Use `Read` tool to read current feature directory Spec.md: `Read Context/Features/[FeatureName]/Spec.md`
║    - If missing: ERROR "Feature specification required for technical planning"
║    - Extract: functional requirements, mentioned technologies, integrations
║
║ 2. **Load Project Context**
║    - Use `Read` tool to read project Context.md: `Read Context.md`
║    - Extract: current tech stack, existing dependencies, architecture patterns
║    - For workspace projects: Use `Read` tool on workspace Context.md for tech preferences
║
║ 3. **Identify Research Targets**
║    - Scan specification for mentioned technologies (frameworks, libraries, APIs)
║    - Identify external services and integration requirements
║    - Mark unfamiliar patterns, architectural approaches, or constraints
║    - List technologies requiring best practice research
║
║ 4. **Launch Comprehensive Codebase Integration Agent**
║    - Create single comprehensive codebase integration agent task:
║      - Agent: "analyze-codebase-integration" with context: "Complete codebase analysis for [feature] integration"
║      - Agent scope: Discovery, pattern analysis, integration planning, complexity assessment
║      - Agent tasks:
║        - Use Glob/Grep to find existing models, views, services related to [feature domain]
║        - Analyze existing architectural patterns, naming conventions, error handling approaches
║        - Determine integration requirements: files to modify vs. new files to create
║        - Assess implementation complexity, potential conflicts, refactoring needs
║        - Map data flow between [feature] and existing components
║      - Agent returns: comprehensive integration strategy with patterns, requirements, complexity analysis
║    - Single agent execution provides complete codebase integration analysis
║    - Result: Unified codebase integration plan without redundant analysis phases
║
║ 5. **Launch Technology Research Agents**
║    - Create focused research agent tasks for each mentioned technology:
║      - Agent: "research-errorkit" with context: "ErrorKit error handling patterns for iOS apps"
║      - Agent: "research-cloudkit" with context: "CloudKit sync capabilities and limitations for feature"
║      - Agent: "research-swiftui" with context: "SwiftUI patterns and best practices for [feature area]"
║      - Each agent receives technology context and feature requirements
║      - **CRITICAL**: Instruct agents to RETURN findings as text response, NOT create markdown files
║      - **Apple Platform Priority Domains**: For iOS/macOS technologies, agents MUST prioritize these domains:
║        - **developer.apple.com** - Official Apple documentation, HIG, sample code
║        - **wwdcnotes.com** - Community WWDC session summaries and best practices
║        - **Active iOS/Swift Community**: swiftbysundell.com, avanderlee.com, hackingwithswift.com, natasharobot.com, swiftwithmajid.com, fatbobman.com, swiftwithvincent.com, donnywals.com, kodeco.com, elkraneo.com
║        - **Indie Developer Insights**: fline.dev and other established Swift developer blogs
║        - **Domain-Limited Searches**: Use `site:developer.apple.com` or `site:wwdcnotes.com` when researching specific topics
║      - **Apple Technology Search Strategy**: For iOS/macOS/Swift technologies, agents use BOTH WebSearch AND iosfeeds.com/archive search for community articles
║      - **iosfeeds.com Usage**: ONLY for Apple platform technologies - Search iosfeeds.com/archive?query=[AppleTechnologyName] to find recent iOS/Swift blog posts
║      - **Non-Apple Technologies**: Use only WebSearch and official documentation for Android, Web, Backend, or other non-Apple technologies
║      - Agents use WebFetch for official docs, return: versions, capabilities, limitations, integration approaches WITH SPECIFIC URLs of key sources that informed findings
║    - Launch technology agents concurrently for parallel research execution
║    - Consolidate agent findings into technology decision matrix with version compatibility and source documentation
║
║ 6. **Launch API Research Agents**
║    - Create API research agent tasks for each external service:
║      - Agent: "research-api-service" with context: "[Service Name] API documentation, rate limits, pricing analysis"
║      - Agent: "research-auth-methods" with context: "[Service] authentication, data formats, iOS SDK analysis"
║      - Each agent receives service context and integration requirements
║      - **CRITICAL**: Instruct agents to RETURN findings as text response, NOT create markdown files
║      - Agents use WebFetch for API docs, return: capabilities, constraints, costs, integration complexity WITH SPECIFIC URLs of key documentation that informed findings
║      - **CRITICAL**: All agents must document SPECIFIC ARTICLES/DOCS that informed findings with exact URLs, version numbers, and last-updated dates
║      - **Key Source Focus**: Document only the most relevant sources that directly informed the documented findings
║    - Execute API research agents concurrently for parallel service evaluation
║    - Consolidate findings into service integration assessment with cost and complexity analysis and complete source documentation
║
║ 7. **Launch Architecture Pattern Research Agents**
║    - Create pattern research agent tasks for complex architectural needs:
║      - Agent: "research-offline-sync" with context: "Offline-first architecture patterns for iOS apps"
║      - Agent: "research-error-patterns" with context: "Modern Swift error handling integration patterns"
║      - Agent: "research-state-management" with context: "SwiftUI state management patterns for [feature complexity]"
║      - Each agent receives pattern context and feature complexity requirements
║      - **CRITICAL**: Instruct agents to RETURN findings as text response, NOT create markdown files
║      - **Source Documentation Requirement**: Agents use WebSearch for best practices and MUST return: implementation approaches, benefits, drawbacks, case studies WITH SPECIFIC URLs of articles that informed findings
║      - **Apple Pattern Priority**: For iOS/macOS patterns, prioritize official Apple guidance and use iosfeeds.com for community articles
║      - **Non-Apple Patterns**: Use WebSearch and official documentation for non-Apple architectural patterns
║      - **Key Source Documentation**: Document SPECIFIC ARTICLES that informed architectural decisions with exact URLs
║      - **iosfeeds.com Article Discovery**: Use iosfeeds.com/archive?query=[PatternName] to find recent iOS community articles on architectural patterns
║      - **Comprehensive Coverage**: Combine WebSearch results with iosfeeds.com findings for complete community perspective
║    - Launch pattern research agents in parallel for concurrent architectural evaluation
║    - Consolidate architectural insights into implementation strategy recommendations with comprehensive source documentation
