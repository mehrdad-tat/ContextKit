║ 🤖 DATABASE OPERATIONS - SELF-MANAGING BACKLOG METHODS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ This file serves as a self-managing database with specific operations that
║ the prioritize-ideas command calls upon. Each operation is documented below.
║
║ ## Operation: BINARY_SEARCH_INSERT
║ **Called by**: prioritize-ideas command during placement phase
║ **Purpose**: Find exact insertion point using comparative positioning
║
║ ### Algorithm:
║ 1. **Reference Selection**: Pick 3 existing ideas from different priority levels
║ 2. **User Choice**: Present A/B/C/D placement options relative to references
║ 3. **Recursive Narrowing**: Based on choice, pick new references from narrower range
║ 4. **Termination**: Continue until exact insertion point between consecutive items
║ 5. **Score Calculation**: Generate decimal priority score for precise positioning
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ - Use Priority Index as source for reference selection
║ - Calculate new score between two adjacent scores: (score1 + score2) / 2
║ - For edge cases: use score - 1.0 (higher priority) or score + 10.0 (lower priority)
║ - Update Priority Index with new entry maintaining sort order
║
║ ## Operation: ADD_ENTRY
║ **Called by**: prioritize-ideas command after binary search placement
║ **Purpose**: Add new idea to database with complete metadata
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Priority Index**: Add "score | ID | title" line in correct sort position
║ 2. **Metadata Tables**: Add entries to Effort, Deadlines, Dependencies as needed
║ 3. **Idea Details**: Add full description in alphabetical order by ID (stable location)
║ 4. **Session Tracking**: Update last rebalance date and context notes
║
║ ## Operation: MOVE_ENTRY
║ **Called by**: prioritize-ideas command during rebalancing
║ **Purpose**: Change priority position of existing idea
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Remove from Priority Index**: Delete current entry
║ 2. **Apply BINARY_SEARCH_INSERT**: Find new position
║ 3. **Update Score**: Assign new priority score
║ 4. **Preserve Metadata**: Keep effort, deadlines, dependencies unchanged
║
║ ## Operation: DEADLINE_BUBBLE_UP
║ **Called by**: prioritize-ideas command during session assessment
║ **Purpose**: Auto-promote ideas approaching deadlines
║
║ ### Algorithm:
║ 1. **Scan Deadlines Table**: Find entries with deadlines <7 days away
║ 2. **Calculate Urgency Score**: Use negative scores (-10.0 to -1.0) based on days remaining
║ 3. **Auto-Promotion**: Move to top of Priority Index with negative score
║ 4. **Notification**: Flag for user attention in session summary
║
║ ## Operation: REBALANCE_SCORES
║ **Called by**: prioritize-ideas command when gaps get too small
║ **Purpose**: Clean up priority scores to maintain insertion space
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Preserve Order**: Keep exact same sort order from Priority Index
║ 2. **Reassign Scores**: Distribute evenly across 1-100 scale with gaps
║ 3. **Critical Preservation**: Keep negative scores for urgent deadlines
║ 4. **Update Index**: Replace all scores while maintaining sort order
║
║ ## Operation: REMOVE_COMPLETED
║ **Called by**: prioritize-ideas command when ideas are implemented
║ **Purpose**: Clean database of completed items
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Remove from Priority Index**: Delete completed entries
║ 2. **Clean Metadata Tables**: Remove from effort, deadlines, dependencies
║ 3. **Archive Details**: Move to archived section or remove entirely
║ 4. **Compact Database**: Clean up any orphaned references
║
║ ## Database Structure Rules:
║ - **Priority Index**: Only section that gets reordered, source of truth for priority
║ - **Idea Details**: Always alphabetical by ID for stability, never reorder
║ - **Metadata Tables**: Update independently, linked by ID
║ - **Session Context**: Track context changes between prioritization sessions
║
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Project**: [AI Generated Project Name from Context.md]
**Database Created**: [AI Generated Current Date]
**Last Priority Session**: [Updated by prioritize-ideas command]
**Priority Scale**: 1-100 (lower score = higher priority, negative = urgent deadlines)
**Next Review Due**: [7 days from last session or when >5 new ideas captured]

## Priority Index (Lower Score = Higher Priority)

_This section gets reordered by database operations - source of truth for current priorities_

```
ACTIVE BACKLOG:

[Entries will be populated by prioritize-ideas command using ADD_ENTRY operation]

Example format:
1.0  | IDEA-003 | Critical user authentication fix
5.2  | IDEA-001 | Add dark mode support
12.8 | IDEA-005 | Export analytics to CSV
25.0 | IDEA-002 | Offline mode for core features
```

## Metadata Tables

### Effort Estimates

```
ID       | Hours  | Notes
---------|--------|------------------------------------------
[Populated by ADD_ENTRY operation based on user assessment]

Example format:
IDEA-001 | 8h     | UI theming + testing across all screens
IDEA-002 | 16h    | Complex sync logic + conflict resolution
IDEA-003 | 2h     | Simple auth flow adjustment
```

### Deadlines

```
ID       | Deadline   | Reason
---------|------------|------------------------------------------
[Populated when ideas have time-sensitive requirements]
[Used by DEADLINE_BUBBLE_UP operation for auto-promotion]

Example format:
IDEA-003 | 2025-09-20 | Customer presentation demo
IDEA-007 | 2025-10-01 | Conference announcement
```

### Dependencies

```
ID       | Depends On | Notes
---------|------------|------------------------------------------
[Populated when ideas have prerequisite work or relationships]

Example format:
IDEA-002 | IDEA-003   | Auth must work before offline sync
IDEA-008 | External   | Waiting for third-party API update
```

## Idea Details (Alphabetical by ID)

_Stable order for easy reference - never reordered by any database operation_

### IDEA-001: [First idea title will appear here]

**Priority Score**: [Score from Priority Index]
**Effort**: [Hours from assessment]
**Source**: [Who suggested this idea]
**Added**: [Date]
**Context**: [Why this idea matters, business value, user benefit]
**Evaluation Notes**: [Clarifications and decisions from prioritization session]

### IDEA-002: [First idea title will appear here]

**Priority Score**: [Score from Priority Index]
**Effort**: [Hours from assessment]
**Source**: [Who suggested this idea]
**Added**: [Date]
**Context**: [Why this idea matters, business value, user benefit]
**Evaluation Notes**: [Clarifications and decisions from prioritization session]

_Additional ideas will be added in alphabetical order by ID using ADD_ENTRY operation_

## Session Management

### Priority Context Tracking

- **Last session context**: [Notes about current business priorities, recent user feedback, strategic focuses]
- **Context changes**: [Major shifts in priorities or business conditions since last review]
- **Rebalance triggers**: Every 7 days OR when 5+ new ideas in inbox

### Decision Patterns

- **User feedback**: Customer requests get noted for follow-up when implemented
- **Business value**: Revenue impact and user satisfaction considerations
- **Technical fit**: How well ideas align with current architecture and capabilities
- **Resource reality**: Development capacity and competing priorities
