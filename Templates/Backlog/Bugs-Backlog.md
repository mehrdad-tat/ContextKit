║ 🤖 DATABASE OPERATIONS - SELF-MANAGING BACKLOG METHODS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ This file serves as a self-managing database with specific operations that
║ the prioritize-bugs command calls upon. Each operation is documented below.
║
║ ## Operation: SEVERITY_BINARY_SEARCH_INSERT
║ **Called by**: prioritize-bugs command during placement phase
║ **Purpose**: Find exact insertion point using severity-effort matrix positioning
║
║ ### Algorithm:
║ 1. **Reference Selection**: Pick 3 existing bugs from different severity-effort combinations
║ 2. **User Choice**: Present A/B/C/D placement options relative to references
║ 3. **Recursive Narrowing**: Based on choice, pick new references from narrower range
║ 4. **Termination**: Continue until exact insertion point between consecutive items
║ 5. **Score Calculation**: Generate severity-weighted decimal score for precise positioning
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ - Use Priority Index as source for reference selection
║ - Weight severity heavily: Critical >> High >> Medium >> Low
║ - Within same severity, simple effort gets slight priority boost
║ - Calculate new score between adjacent: (score1 + score2) / 2
║ - Critical bugs get negative scores (-10.0 to -1.0) for immediate attention
║
║ ## Operation: ADD_BUG_ENTRY
║ **Called by**: prioritize-bugs command after severity assessment
║ **Purpose**: Add new bug to database with complete triage metadata
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Priority Index**: Add "score | ID | title" line in severity-weighted sort position
║ 2. **Metadata Tables**: Add entries to Severity, Effort, Impact tables
║ 3. **Bug Details**: Add full description in alphabetical order by ID (stable location)
║ 4. **Triage Tracking**: Update last triage session date and critical bug count
║
║ ## Operation: MOVE_BUG_ENTRY
║ **Called by**: prioritize-bugs command during re-triage
║ **Purpose**: Change severity/priority position of existing bug
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Remove from Priority Index**: Delete current entry
║ 2. **Apply SEVERITY_BINARY_SEARCH_INSERT**: Find new position
║ 3. **Update Score**: Assign new severity-weighted score
║ 4. **Update Metadata**: Revise severity, effort, impact assessments as needed
║
║ ## Operation: CRITICAL_ESCALATION
║ **Called by**: prioritize-bugs command when critical bugs detected
║ **Purpose**: Auto-promote critical bugs and notify for immediate attention
║
║ ### Algorithm:
║ 1. **Critical Detection**: Identify bugs marked as Critical severity
║ 2. **Urgent Scoring**: Assign negative scores (-10.0 to -1.0) based on impact
║ 3. **Auto-Promotion**: Move to top of Priority Index
║ 4. **Alert Generation**: Flag for immediate attention in session summary
║ 5. **Escalation Tracking**: Log critical bug count and escalation history
║
║ ## Operation: SEVERITY_REBALANCE
║ **Called by**: prioritize-bugs command when score gaps get too small
║ **Purpose**: Clean up priority scores while maintaining severity weighting
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Preserve Severity Order**: Critical > High > Medium > Low groupings maintained
║ 2. **Within-Group Rebalance**: Redistribute scores within each severity group
║ 3. **Critical Preservation**: Keep negative scores for critical bugs
║ 4. **Effort Consideration**: Maintain slight priority boost for simple fixes
║
║ ## Operation: REMOVE_FIXED
║ **Called by**: prioritize-bugs command when bugs are resolved
║ **Purpose**: Clean database of fixed bugs
║
║ ### Implementation:
║ 1. **Remove from Priority Index**: Delete fixed bug entries
║ 2. **Clean Metadata Tables**: Remove from severity, effort, impact tables
║ 3. **Archive Details**: Move to fixed section or remove entirely
║ 4. **Update Stats**: Adjust critical bug count and triage metrics
║
║ ## Severity-Effort Matrix Rules:
║ **Priority Calculation Formula**:
║ - Critical + Any Effort = Negative scores (immediate attention)
║ - High + Simple = 1-10 range
║ - High + Medium/Complex = 10-20 range
║ - Medium + Simple = 20-30 range
║ - Medium + Medium/Complex = 30-50 range
║ - Low + Any Effort = 50-100 range
║
║ ## Database Structure Rules:
║ - **Priority Index**: Severity-weighted sorting, reordered by triage operations
║ - **Bug Details**: Always alphabetical by ID for stability, never reorder
║ - **Metadata Tables**: Update independently, linked by ID
║ - **Critical Tracking**: Special handling for bugs requiring immediate attention
║

**Project**: [AI Generated Project Name from Context.md]
**Database Created**: [AI Generated Current Date]
**Last Triage Session**: [Updated by prioritize-bugs command]
**Priority Scale**: 1-100 (lower score = higher priority, negative = critical)
**Critical Bugs**: [Count of bugs with negative scores requiring immediate attention]

## Priority Index (Lower Score = Higher Priority)

*This section gets reordered by database operations - severity-weighted priority order*

```
ACTIVE BUG BACKLOG:

[Entries will be populated by prioritize-bugs command using ADD_BUG_ENTRY operation]

Example format:
-5.0 | BUG-003 | Critical login crash affecting all users
-2.1 | BUG-007 | Data loss in sync operation
 2.5 | BUG-001 | High priority UI responsiveness issue
15.0 | BUG-005 | Medium priority export validation
45.0 | BUG-002 | Low priority button alignment
```

## Metadata Tables

### Severity Assessment
```
ID       | Severity | Impact Details
---------|----------|------------------------------------------
[Populated by ADD_BUG_ENTRY operation based on user triage]

Example format:
BUG-001  | High     | Core feature broken, affects 80% users
BUG-002  | Low      | Cosmetic issue, minimal user impact
BUG-003  | Critical | App crash on launch, affects all users
```

### Effort Estimates
```
ID       | Effort   | Complexity Notes
---------|----------|------------------------------------------
[Populated by ADD_BUG_ENTRY operation based on fix complexity]

## Triage Management

### Severity Definitions
- **Critical**: App crashes, data loss, security issues, complete feature failures
- **High**: Core functionality broken, significant user impact, difficult workarounds
- **Medium**: Feature degraded but usable, minor user impact, workarounds available
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor UI problems, edge cases, polish items

### Effort Classifications
- **Simple**: 1-3 hours - UI fixes, text changes, obvious bugs
- **Medium**: 4-12 hours - Logic fixes, single component changes
- **Complex**: 1-3 days - Architecture issues, multiple system fixes
- **Major**: 1+ weeks - Fundamental redesigns (consider converting to feature)

### Critical Bug Escalation
- **Immediate attention**: Critical bugs get negative priority scores via CRITICAL_ESCALATION
- **Hotfix pipeline**: Separate release process for critical fixes
- **Communication**: Stakeholder notification for user-impacting criticals
- **Verification**: Extra testing and validation for critical fixes

## Session Tracking

### Triage Context
- **Last session context**: [Notes about critical issues, user feedback, system stability]
- **Context changes**: [Major shifts in bug patterns or system health since last triage]
- **Review triggers**: When 5+ new bugs in inbox OR critical issues reported

### Bug Patterns
- **Common issues**: Recurring bug types and root causes
- **Fix difficulty**: Effort estimation accuracy and improvement patterns
- **Impact assessment**: User feedback correlation with severity assessments
- **System health**: Overall bug trend analysis
