## Description
Execute iOS/macOS app release workflow with constitutional compliance validation and App Store Connect preparation

## Parameters
- `version` (required): Semantic version for release (e.g., "1.2.0")

## Execution Flow (main)

### Phase 0: Check Customization
0. **Read the "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

### Phase 1: Prerequisites Validation
1. **Verify project readiness**
   - Use `Glob` to check for `*.xcodeproj`: If missing, ERROR "Not an iOS/macOS app project - use /ctxk:impl:release-package for Swift packages" → EXIT
   - Use `Bash` to check git status: `git status --porcelain`
   - If uncommitted changes: ERROR "Commit all changes before release using /ctxk:impl:commit-changes" → EXIT
   - Use `Read` to verify `Context.md` exists: If missing, ERROR "Run /ctxk:proj:init to set up ContextKit first" → EXIT

### Phase 2: Change Analysis and Version Planning
2. **Analyze all changes since last release**
   - Use `Bash` to find latest release tag: `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1`
   - If no tags found: Set LAST_TAG to initial commit for full history analysis
   - Use `Bash` to get commit overview: `git log --oneline LAST_TAG..HEAD`
   - Use `Bash` to get complete code changes: `git diff LAST_TAG..HEAD` for full diff analysis
   - **Analyze conversation context for additional insights:**
     - Review current chat conversation for work performed and context
     - Understand the intent behind changes made during this development session
     - Cross-reference with git changes to ensure accurate release notes

3. **Suggest next version based on change analysis**
   Analyze code changes to suggest version bump:
   - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes, removed features, major UX overhauls
   - **MINOR**: New features, significant improvements, new user-facing functionality
   - **PATCH**: Bug fixes, minor improvements, performance optimizations

4. **Get version confirmation from user**
   - Display version context in chat:
     ```
     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     📦 VERSION CONFIRMATION - Please Review
     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     Current Version: [current version from project]

     Changes Found:
     [Summary of changes since last release]

     Suggested Version: [suggested version] ([MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH])
     Reasoning: [why this version bump is recommended]

     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ```
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool to ask for version confirmation
   - Accept specific version (e.g., "1.2.0") or suggestion via options
   - Validate semantic version format

5. **Generate release notes as simple prioritized list**
   Analyze changes and create sorted list following Keep a Changelog order:

   **Include in release notes (sorted by importance within each category):**
   - **Added**: New features, functionality, UI elements users can access
   - **Changed**: Behavior changes, improved features, UX enhancements
   - **Deprecated**: Features marked for future removal (rare for apps)
   - **Removed**: Deleted features or functionality
   - **Fixed**: Bug fixes that affect user experience, crashes, incorrect behavior
   - **Security**: Security improvements affecting user privacy or app security

   **Exclude from release notes:**
   - Internal refactoring, code cleanup, dependency updates
   - Developer tooling, build system changes, tests
   - Code formatting, documentation, comments

6. **Iterate on release notes with user feedback**
   - Display generated release notes in chat:
     ```
     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     📝 GENERATED RELEASE NOTES - Please Review
     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

     [Generated release notes as simple bullet list organized by category]

     ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ```
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool to ask: "Use these release notes? (Y/n/r to revise - tell me what to change)"
   - **Y**: Continue with generated notes
   - **n**: Skip release notes (empty What's New)
   - **r**: Revise - use text input to ask user for specific improvement requests, then regenerate

   **If user chooses "r" (revise):**
   - Prompt: "How should I improve these release notes? Examples:"
     - "Make the first point more specific about the new search feature"
     - "Combine the last two bug fix points into one"
     - "Add more detail about the performance improvements"
     - "Use more user-friendly language, less technical"
     - "Reorder by importance - put the UI changes first"
   - Take user feedback and regenerate improved version
   - Repeat Y/n/r cycle until user approves or skips

### Phase 3: Version Management and Git Operations
7. **Update project version**
   - Use `Read` to examine project.pbxproj file structure
   - Use `Edit` to update MARKETING_VERSION to provided version parameter
   - Keep CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION at "1" (Xcode Cloud manages build numbers)
   - Verify version consistency across Debug and Release configurations

8. **Execute git workflow**
   - Determine appropriate commit message:
     - If only MARKETING_VERSION changed: "Bump version to [version]"
     - If both MARKETING_VERSION and CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION changed: "Bump version and build number to [version]"
   - Use `Bash` to commit version changes with appropriate message
   - Use `Bash` to create release tag: `git tag [version]`
   - Prepare for user to push: `git push && git push --tags`
   - Tag push will trigger Xcode Cloud build automatically

### Phase 4: App Store Connect Preparation
9. **Display What's New text for App Store Connect**
   - Use `Read` to get App Store URL from Context.md configuration
   - Extract Apple ID from App Store URL (pattern: `/id(\d+)`)
   - Present final release notes as formatted "What's New" text
   - Show copy-pasteable format for App Store Connect
   - Provide direct App Store Connect URL using extracted Apple ID

### Phase 5: Completion and Next Steps
10. **Finalize and provide guidance**
   - Summarize constitutional compliance results
   - List files created and modified
   - Provide clear next steps for user:
     - Push commits and tags to trigger Xcode Cloud
     - Monitor build progress in Xcode Cloud dashboard
     - Submit for review once build completes
   - Reference Guidelines/Release.md for detailed App Store Connect procedures

11. **Return SUCCESS** with release prepared and ready for user to push

## Success Message

🚀 Next steps:
   1. Push commits and tags: git push && git push --tags
   2. Monitor Xcode Cloud dashboard for build progress
   3. Copy What's New text above and paste into App Store Connect
   4. Submit for review once build completes
```

## Error Conditions
- "Not an app project" → Use /ctxk:impl:release-package for Swift packages → EXIT
- "Uncommitted changes" → Commit all changes first using /ctxk:impl:commit-changes → EXIT
- "No Context.md found" → Run /ctxk:proj:init to set up ContextKit first → EXIT
- "Version conflicts" → Resolve git tag conflicts or project version inconsistencies
- "No meaningful changes" → Consider if maintenance release is necessary

## Validation Gates
- [ ] Project is iOS/macOS app with *.xcodeproj file?
- [ ] Git repository is clean with all changes committed?
- [ ] User-facing changes identified and documented?
- [ ] Version number confirmed by user?
- [ ] Release notes approved or skipped by user?
- [ ] Project version updated correctly in all configurations?
- [ ] Git tag created and ready for push?
- [ ] Next steps provided for user (push, monitor, submit)?

## Integration Points
- **Commands**: Integrates with /ctxk:impl:commit-changes and /ctxk:impl:start-working
- **Guidelines**: References Guidelines/Release.md for detailed App Store Connect procedures
