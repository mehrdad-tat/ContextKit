║ ## When to Add Entries
║ 
║ Add entries for ANY file changes in the ContextKit repository:
║ - New files created
║ - Existing files modified (content, structure, format changes)
║ - Files moved or renamed
║ - Files deleted
║ - Directory structure changes
║ 
║ ## Entry Format Rules
║ 
║ Always use full file paths from repository root:
║ - ✅ `Templates/Commands/proj/init.md` 
║ - ❌ `init.md` or `proj/init.md`
║ 
║ Include brief description of what changed and short commit SHA:
║ - ✅ `Templates/Scripts/AutoFormat.sh` - Added Swift 6 compatibility (a1b2c3d)
║ - ❌ `Templates/Scripts/AutoFormat.sh` - Updated
║ 
║ Commit SHA format:
║ - Use short 7-character SHA: (a1b2c3d)
║ - Get with: git rev-parse --short HEAD
║ - Enables /migrate command to examine exact git changes
║ 
║ ## Migration Markers
║ 
║ Use [M] prefix for changes that affect existing user projects:
║ - [M] Template files that users customize (commands, agents, hooks)
║ - [M] File moves/renames that require path updates
║ - [M] File deletions that need cleanup
║ - [M] Configuration changes that affect user settings
║ 
║ No marker for safe changes:
║ - Documentation updates (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
║ - New optional files users can adopt gradually
║ - Repository infrastructure that doesn't affect deployed projects
║ 
║ ## Changelog Sections
║ 
║ Use standard Keep a Changelog format:
║ - Added: New files and features
║ - Changed: Modifications to existing files
║ - Deprecated: Soon-to-be removed features (with timeline)
║ - Removed: Files and features removed in this version
║ - Fixed: Bug fixes
║ - Security: Security improvements
║ 
║ ## Release Process
║ 
║ When making a release:
║ 1. Update first line: **Current Version: X.X.X** to new version number
║ 2. Change [Unreleased] to [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD
║ 3. Remove empty sections from the released version
